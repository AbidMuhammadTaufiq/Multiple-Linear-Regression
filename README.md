# Multiple-Linear-Regression
calculating multiple linear regression in python

Regression analysis is used to measure the influence between the independent variables and the dependent variable. Multiple linear regression is a regression model that involves more than one independent variable. Multiple linear regression analysis was carried out to determine the direction and how much influence the independent variables have on the dependent variable.

case study:
Leading technology companies are conducting research on the relationship between competence and compensation given to employees on employee performance. Given a random data on the influence of competency variables (X1), compensation (X2) on employee performance variables (Y) of the company.

Determine the multiple Y regression equation for X1 and X2 then what insight can be obtained from the calculation results.
